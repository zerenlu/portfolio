			<p class="bio">
				I am currently an electrical engineer student at TU Munich. After meeting Web development at Coursera I found my passion and knew that Web developer is my right career path. Along with the programming experience from MATLB and C/C++, I learned HTML, CSS and JavaScript and build projects during my part time.
